## Schedule Email

Good [morning/afternoon] [INSERT NAME],

In your phone interview with Don, he mentioned that I would be reaching out to schedule some time to take a front end dev test. Iâ€™m emailing to see what your availability is in the next few days to take the test. The test itself will:

* Test your skills in HTML, CSS, and JS
* Take 3 hours
* Can be done during the day, after work, or on the weekend (your choice)
* Need to be scheduled in advance
* Only need a browser and internet connection to complete (via CodePen)
* Consist of consuming an API to display some data
* Be fun (if you like Star Wars and coding)

Right before the scheduled time, I will email you full instructions with some assets and resources.

Please reply and let me know when you can set aside a 3 hour window for me to administer the test.

Thank you!

## Test Appointment

Instructions will be send right before [ENTER START TIME] EST. You will be using CodePen to share your work.
